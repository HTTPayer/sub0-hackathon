# ai-rkiv CLI Agent

`ai-rkiv` is an example CLI agent that:

- Connects to Polkadot via PAPI (Polkadot-API)
- Takes snapshots of stash-account state
- Uses Arkivendor&apos;s x402-protected HTTP API (via a lightweight SDK layer of arkivolts) to store and query those snapshots

See the root `README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for an overview of how `ai-rkiv` fits into the Arkivendor architecture.
