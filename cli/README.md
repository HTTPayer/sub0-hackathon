# AI-Spuro CLI Agent

`AI-Spuro` is an example CLI agent that:

- Connects to Polkadot via PAPI (Polkadot-API)
- Takes snapshots of stash-account state
- Uses Spuro&apos;s x402-protected HTTP API (via a lightweight SDK layer of Spuro Functions) to store and query those snapshots

See the root `README.md` and `docs/README.md` for an overview of how `AI-Spuro` fits into the Spuro architecture.
