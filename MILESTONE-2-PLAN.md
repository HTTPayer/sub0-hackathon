**Milestone-2 / Post-Hack Plan**

- Turn **AI-Spuro** from a CLI demo into an **AI SDK** so other teams can build their own custom agents (in Node.js/TypeScript) that plug into Spuro.
- Extend the docs/catalogue into a richer view of plug-and-play Arkiv-backed "Spuro Functions" that agents can call via HTTP/x402.
- Build a UI for users (nominators) to onboard their stash addresses and visualize historical balance trends.
- Add alerting when balances change or drift beyond thresholds (via webhooks / Discord / email).
- Expand to track other on-chain data (validators, nominator reward destinations, staking rewards).
- Introduce session-budgeting in HTTPayer so agents can be scoped to a weekly or monthly pay-as-you-go spend.
